About
-----

SoothsayeR is an interface developed in R based on the old prank called
‘**Peter answers**’..

The game’s idea is to play with your friends making questions that you
know the answer, and make them believe that <b>soothsayeR</b> is who is
answering…

The tool is online on shinyapps’ repository at the address
<a href="https://adsoncostanzi.shinyapps.io/soothsayeR/" class="uri">https://adsoncostanzi.shinyapps.io/soothsayeR/</a>.

How to play with soothsayeR?
----------------------------

You just need to press **dot** (.) on the keyboard in the request
session and then write the answer secretly. When you press **dot** in
the request text input everything you type will be masked, so you could
put the answer without anyone noticing.

Then, when you have finished typing the answer you just need to press
dot again and complete the request phrase anyway you want.
